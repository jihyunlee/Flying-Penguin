Flying Penguin
==============

I am proposing Flying<em> Penguin</em> for my thesis at <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/" target="_blank">ITP</a>.

This project is a cloud-based platform that encourages children under age 5 to 11 with asthma to practice breathing as part of game play. It is still in progress.

I started to research about diverse lung diseases and breathing practice. While researching, I found out that a large number of U.S. children(14%) have ever been diagnosed with asthma; 10% population of children still have asthma. It is a lot!

There are many research about how breathing exercise helps manage asthma. So what if kids can have fun breathing?

I had interview with some experts in asthma. Based on my research, I created the wireframe I am envisioning. But I am still researching about how to what is the most effective way to practice breath.
